# GA4Dataform Community

GA4Dataform Community is the open-source version of GA4Dataform Core.
This open-source repository contains all the Dataform files and folders that the [GA4Dataform Installer](https://setup.ga4dataform.com/) creates in Dataform.

You can use this repository to:
1. Explore the code before installing it
2. Implement parts of our queries or functions to your existing code
3. Connect it to your Dataform repository by yourself

Please take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.ga4dataform.com/docs/) if you want to learn more about GA4Dataform!

## Installation Tips

If you want to install our most up-to-date version of GA4Dataform or an easy and quick way to deploy it to your project, please use the [Installer](https://setup.ga4dataform.com/)!

We will try to keep this open-source repository as updated as we can, but there might be some delay. Use this repository at your own risk!

### 1. Clone this repository and connect your Git repo to Dataform
If you choose this route, you will be able to keep iterating on the existing models with a Git connection that you own. The downside is that you will have to update the repository yourself (if you want to) when we roll out new versions.

1. Run git clone locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/superformlabs/ga4dataform-community.git
```
2. Push the cloned files to a Git repository that you own
3. Connect your Git repository with Dataform

### 2. Connect your Dataform repository to this Github repo

Connecting your Dataform repository to this Github repo (even just temporarily) is probably the least amount of effort to move all files and folders to your workspace. The downside is that you will have to disconnect Github if you want to add your own queries to the workspace.
